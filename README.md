Hello, here's a breakdown of the Quiz and my thought process on it.

## What is the Quiz about?
The quiz is a bunch of general knowledge stuff that you don't need to be a history nut to stand a chance. The quiz is based off a TV show that broadcasts in Britain called the 1% Club.

To put it simply, it's a show of questions taken from a survey and they go from 90% of the people answer correctly to 1%.

## Style
I'll be honest, I wasn't so worried about style as I was about programming. I didn't skimp out too much on working on it but it is very minimalistic.

I decided to go with yellow and whites just because it looked nice and I didn't want to use blue or green anymore. I knew I needed to branch out a little bit to see what stuck. 

## JavaScript
I wanted to try to make it easy to change out in case I wanted a different question and answer.

Most of my thought process is in the comments for them but the only real struggle I had was getting the selected options and resetting them when you reload the browser.
